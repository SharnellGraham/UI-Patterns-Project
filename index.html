                <br>  The Glock was created in 1982 by curtain-rod manufacturer Gaston Glock. Glock didn't like the handguns available on the market and decided to manufacture a new gun from scratch. 
                Before starting, he asked gun experts in his native Austria what could be done to improve a handgun for the modern era.A popular glock is the Glock 19's striker-fired trigger design makes it easy to engage with the pistol accurately. 
                Its trigger pull is fairly lightweight, with a positive and short reset that makes shooting the weapon easy. It's large enough to be easy to control, and its 9mm rounds aren't known for their excessive recoil.

            For over 25 years the gun community knew us as STI, the company that evolved John Browning's classic 1911 design into the 2011® gun platform. With its sophisticated ergonomics, increased capacity, and less recoil, our 2011® pistols were embraced by competition shooters for their speed and accuracy.In 1990, Virgil Tripp, a gunsmith and machinist, started building custom M1911s for competition use, especially the United States Practical Shooting Association/International Practical Shooting Confederation. After some time, Virgil began designing parts for 1911s, including electrical discharge machining (EDM) hammers and sears. Virgil's company was called Tripp Research, Inc. and most of his parts were sold and marketed by Chip McCormick, a champion pistol shooter, under his company's name, Chip McCormick Corporation (known as CMC).
            In June 1994, Sandy Strayer left STI to start a new company called Strayer Voigt Inc, which focuses on building completely custom pistols as opposed to the "semi-custom" models of STI.
            In November 1994, Dave and Shirley Skinner, owners of an electronics company named Tessco, Inc., became involved in the operation of STI along with Virgil Tripp. In early 1997, the Skinners completed their purchase of STI from Virgil Tripp and renamed the company to STI International, Inc. Virgil went on to start a new company using the name Tripp Research, Inc., which produces various finishes for firearms and magazines for 1911s. During the Clinton era high-capacity ban, STI remained in business by focusing on exports and the growing concealed-carry market. As of 2007, STI was the third-largest exporter of pistols in America.
            From 1994 to the late 1990s, STI had a custom shop which would build guns to customer's specifications.
            In January 2005, Dave Skinner sold the company to the employees of STI, making it the first employee-owned company in the firearms industry.
            In 2010, Tim Dillon was hired and made President and CEO, and later joined the Board of Directors. Dillon left the company in early 2014.
            In 2014, Greg Mooney joined STI as the President/CEO and a Member of the Board of Directors.
            In 2017, a private equity group, Westwind Investors, purchased STI.
            In 2020, STI announced its name change to Staccato.

         The United States military, as well as special forces and police around the world use KAC RIS/RAS conversions for many popular firearms, including the American M16/M4 rifles and the popular Heckler & Koch MP5 series submachine guns. 
         The RIS/RAS system allows for the mounting of accessories to firearms without additional tools or modifications, and is used, alongside a KAC suppressor and forward grip on the "Special Operations Peculiar MODification" 
         (SOPMOD) M4 carbine package in use by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).
         These can include tactical flashlights, laser targeting units, bipods, and vertical foregrips.
          In addition, KAC produces sound suppressors for the Heckler & Koch Mark 23 SOCOM pistol. KAC also produces a line of clip-on night vision and thermal weapon sights, including the AN/PVS-22 Universal Night Sight.[4] KAC produces mounts for optics and grenade launchers, as well as backup iron sights.
          Knight's Armament produces a line of firearms including the semi-automatic SR-15 line of rifles, the fully automatic SR-16 carbine, the semi-automatic SR-25 sniper rifle, the SR-25 based Mark 11 Mod 0 Sniper Weapon System and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System. KAC also produces the Stoner LMG in limited quantities. As their apparently most original design, KAC is producing the Knight's Armament Company PDW. In 2011, KAC has released the SR15/SR16 E3 line of rifles.
